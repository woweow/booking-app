Image uploads for booking requests:

Photos use Vercel Blob storage (@vercel/blob). Uploads will 500 without proper setup.

Setup steps:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → your project → Storage tab
2. Click "Create Database" → select "Blob"
3. Name it (e.g., "booking-photos") and create it
4. Connect it to your project — this auto-injects BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN into all deployments
5. Redeploy the app (the env var takes effect on next deploy)

If the store already exists but uploads still 500:
- Go to Storage → your blob store → Settings → check the token is connected to this project
- Go to Settings → Environment Variables → verify BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN exists for Production

Local dev:
- Copy the token from Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Settings into .env.local
