# Pre-Launch TODO

## Email
- [ ] Change email FROM address in `src/lib/email.ts` from `onboarding@resend.dev` to the real domain (e.g. `bookings@yourdomain.com`). Currently using Resend's test domain for development since the real domain isn't included in the open-source repo.

## Payments
- [ ] Switch Stripe from sandbox/test mode to live mode with production API keys.

## SMS
- [ ] Switch Twilio from test account to production account with real credentials.
