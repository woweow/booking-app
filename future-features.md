# payments
- Quick sale - charge someone for something random, outside the bounds of an appointment. Just open a terminal, type $x, charge. The customer can tap to pay, email link, QR code

# UX
- Making navigating to collect payment button a single tap away from the chat interface
- able to send clients an estimate of total cost when approving
