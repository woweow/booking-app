# Break the Barriers

Take something powerful that's locked behind expertise, cost, or infrastructure — and put it in everyone's hands.
</h2>

<!--
"Hey Anthropic, thanks for having me."

"For this hackathon project I decided to tackle Problem Statement Two: Break the Barriers. Take something powerful that's locked behind expertise and cost and put it in someone else's hands — in everyone's hands."

# My wife pays $200/month for booking software.

<!--
"My wife owns a small business — she's a tattoo artist. In order to book her clients she pays for a software platform that costs a few hundred dollars a month. Not only does she have to pay $200 a month, but she's at the whims of their development team for what features they build."

<h2>One week. Claude Opus 4.6.</h2>

<!--
"The advancements in AI allow us to own our own tools. The floor for creating the software we use in our daily lives has been elevated. I was able to sit down and build her a complete replacement in one week using Claude Opus 4.6."

"I'll show you the demo in a moment, but there are a couple things I want to call out first."

# Production integrations, built in.

<div class="service-grid mt-12">
  <div class="service-pill">Stripe</div>
  <div class="service-pill">Twilio</div>
  <div class="service-pill">Google Calendar</div>
</div>

<!--
"Stripe integration is ready to go for taking payments. We're hooked up with Twilio for sending emails and text message notifications. And we're connected to my wife's Google Calendar so she can see her appointments on the go."

"With that — let's take a look at what I've built."

# Key Features — Books

<v-clicks>

- **Custom books** — clients request unique pieces
- **Flash books** — pre-made art, book a piece as-is
- **Configurable availability** — set days and hours per book
- **Image uploads** — clients share reference art

</v-clicks>

<!--
"She can create different types of books. Custom books let clients come to her with an idea — they can upload reference images, describe what they want, and start a conversation. Flash books are the opposite — she uploads her own art and clients can claim a piece as-is."

"When she opens a book, she defines her availability. Tuesdays 9 to 5, Saturdays 4 to 6 — whatever fits her schedule. That becomes the set of time slots clients can book from."

# Key Features — The Flow

<v-clicks>

- **Chat** — artist and client align on vision
- **Scheduling** — clients pick from available time slots
- **Deposits** — collected via Stripe before confirmation
- **Calendar sync** — appointments land on Google Calendar

</v-clicks>

<!--
"Once a client submits a booking, the chat opens up. My wife can go back and forth with them to make sure their vision aligns with the work she does. Once she's happy, she activates the appointment — the client picks a date from her available slots, and that slot gets consumed."

"During this process we collect a deposit through Stripe. And when the appointment is confirmed, it syncs straight to her Google Calendar so she can see it on the go."
-->

# Key Features — Through Completion

<v-clicks>

- **Email reminders** — one week before the appointment
- **SMS reminders** — day of via Twilio
- **Checkout** — Stripe payment request on completion
- **Full lifecycle** — from first message to final payment

</v-clicks>

<!--
"As the appointment approaches, the client gets an email reminder a week out. Day of, they get a text message. When my wife finishes the tattoo, she closes the appointment — which triggers a Stripe payment request for the remaining balance."

"The whole thing is end-to-end. From the first message to the final payment, it's all handled in one platform that she owns."

# Let's take a look.

<!--
This is the demo transition. Switch to the live app.

DEMO WALKTHROUGH:

1. BOOKS — "I've given her the ability to create multiple types of tattoo appointments called Books. Here we can see she has custom books as well as flash books."

2. CUSTOM BOOKINGS — "Custom books allow for back and forth with the customer — you can see here they can upload images to create their appointments."

3. CHAT — "There's a chat integration where the artist can go back and forth with clients to discuss before confirming appointments."

4. MANAGEMENT SUITE — "My wife has an entire management suite. She can configure her books for how much they cost, deposits, all of it."

5. CHECKOUT FLOW — "It takes us all the way through the checkout process when the tattoo is completed, where she can charge the customer."

6. THE FULL PICTURE — "Customers can put in deposits, and it has everything my wife wishes she had in her previous application."

<h2>Every service on the free tier.</h2>

<!--
"The best part: using the entirely free tier of every service, after the input costs of the tokens, my wife now has a platform she can use from here on out — totally for free — replacing the few hundred dollars a month she was previously spending."

# Own your tools.

<!--
"I really think this demonstrates just how powerful models like Opus 4.6 are. They enable us to create our own software, remove the gatekeeping of software tools in our lives, and own our own tools."

"Thank you so much to Anthropic for hosting this hackathon."
