# payments
- Quick sale - charge someone for something random, outside the bounds of an appointment. Just open a terminal, type $x, charge. The customer can tap to pay, email link, QR code

# UX
- Making navigating to collect payment button a single tap away from the chat interface
- able to send clients an estimate of total cost when approving

# Booking
- When a client goes to schedule an appointment, today they see the time range that the artist is availabl (9-5) which is confusing because "what time does the appointment start?". Flash pieces have time estimates and custom pieces should have the ability for the artist To set a time estimate whenever they approve the request. This time value should be used to filter appointments. So if the artist has said that there is estimated to be 8 hours, then they should only be able to see dates that have 8 hours available. If it's 4 hours then they can book on that day. From the client's perspective, if it's a 4-hour tattoo and the artist is available 9-5, they are not choosing the 9-5 slot. They're just choosing that day and it's going to give them the start time at 9:00 a.m. And it should block off from 9 to 4 hours from then which means that the next client who books a 4-hour tattoo could book after that.
